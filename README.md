# FuckingRemember: Your Dailies

Automatically reminds you to deliver your finished Burning Crusade dailies every time you enter Shattrath. Sigh.

You can also check your finished dailies manually by typing `/fuckingremember` anywhere in the world.

Requires World of Warcraft - The Burning Crusade! (TBC 2.4.3)
